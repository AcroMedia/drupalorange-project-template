# Commerce 2.x project template

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/drupalcommerce/project-base.svg?branch=8.x)](https://travis-ci.org/drupalcommerce/project-base)

Use [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) to get Drupal + Commerce 2.x with all dependencies.

Based on [drupal-composer/drupal-project](https://github.com/drupal-composer/drupal-project).

## Usage

First you need to [install composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx).

> Note: The instructions below refer to the [global composer installation](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#globally).
You might need to replace `composer` with `php composer.phar` (or similar) for your setup.

After that you can create the project:

```
composer create-project drupalcommerce/project-base some-dir --stability dev --no-interaction
```

Done! Use `composer require ...` to download additional modules and themes:

```
cd some-dir
composer require "drupal/devel:8.1.x-dev"
```

## What does the template do?

* Drupal is installed in the `web` directory.
* Modules (packages of type `drupal-module`) are placed in `web/modules/contrib/`
* Theme (packages of type `drupal-theme`) are placed in `web/themes/contrib/`
* Profiles (packages of type `drupal-profile`) are placed in `web/profiles/contrib/`
* Creates default writable versions of `settings.php` and `services.yml`.
* Creates the `sites/default/files` directory.
* Latest version of Drush is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drush`.
* Latest version of DrupalConsole is installed locally for use at `vendor/bin/drupal`.

## Updating Drupal Core

Updating Drupal core is a two-step process.

1. Update the version number of `drupal/core` in `composer.json`.
1. Run `composer update drupal/core`.
1. Run `./scripts/drupal/update-scaffold [drush-version-spec]` to update files
   in the `web` directory, where `drush-version-spec` is an optional identifier
   acceptable to Drush, e.g. `drupal-8.0.x` or `drupal-8.1.x`, corresponding to
   the version you specified in `composer.json`. (Defaults to `drupal-8`, the
   latest stable release.) Review the files for any changes and restore any
   customizations to `.htaccess` or `robots.txt`.
1. Commit everything all together in a single commit, so `web` will remain in
   sync with the `core` when checking out branches or running `git bisect`.

## FAQ

### Should I commit the contrib modules I download

Composer recommends **no**. They provide [argumentation against but also workrounds if a project decides to do it anyway](https://getcomposer.org/doc/faqs/should-i-commit-the-dependencies-in-my-vendor-directory.md).

### How can I apply patches to downloaded modules?

If you need to apply patches (depending on the project being modified, a pull request is often a better solution), you can do so with the [composer-patches](https://github.com/cweagans/composer-patches) plugin.

To add a patch to drupal module foobar insert the patches section in the extra section of composer.json:
```json
"extra": {
    "patches": {
        "drupal/foobar": {
            "Patch description": "URL to patch"
        }
    }
}
```
